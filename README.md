# ping
pong the rpg

_enemy ability ideas(skills enemies use)_
- dissapearing ball( a second or two)
- phantom split(one fake splits off from the main one to fake out the player)
- time stop(ball will freeze for a moment to throw the player off)
- reverse pong(ball will change color and the player will need to avoid instead of hitting it)

_Paddle Ideas_
- momentum affects speed and direction of the ball
- ability to change size of paddle for a limited amount of time

_Enviornment ideas_
- different enemies have different room layouts(round, square, ect)
- the different rooms will also have obstacles that appear and or are static
